<h1>EMNIST Letter Classification Using a Hopfield Network</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This paper explores the use of Hopfield networks for classifying handwritten letters from the EMNIST dataset. Hopfield networks are associative memory networks that can retrieve patterns by minimizing an energy function. The study proposes using a Hopfield layer as an attention layer, with the inverse temperature Î² as a hyper-parameter that controls the focal length of the attention. The Hopfield network model achieved promising results, outperforming some state-of-the-art benchmarks for the EMNIST letter classification task with a test accuracy of 91.33%. The main contribution of this paper is the use of a Hopfield layer as a tunable attention mechanism for character recognition, which could be applied to other computer vision tasks.
